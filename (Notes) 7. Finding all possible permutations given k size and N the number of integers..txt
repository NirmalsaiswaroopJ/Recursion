Finding all possible permutations given k size and N number of integers.

Step 1: Initialize an empty list to store the results.
Step 2: Define a recursive function backtrack(start, combo) that generates combinations of length k.
Step 3: Iterate over each number from 1 to n.
Step 4: For each number, initiate the backtrack function with the current number as the starting point and an empty combination list.
Step 5: In the backtrack function:
- If the length of the current combination combo equals k, add a copy of the combination to the results list.
- Otherwise, iterate over numbers from the current start to n (inclusive).
- For each number i, append it to the combination, increment start by 1, and recursively call backtrack with the updated parameters.
- After the recursive call, remove the last element from the combination (backtrack) to explore other possibilities.
Step 6: Repeat steps 3-5 for each number from 1 to n.

Here's how it works step by step:

Start with an empty combination: [].
Start with number 1, initiate backtrack: backtrack(1, []).
At this point, we'll consider combinations starting with 1.
In the backtrack function:
Start = 1, so we consider appending 1 to the combination:
Add 1 to the combination: [1].
Recursively call backtrack with start = 2: backtrack(2, [1]).
Start = 2, so we consider appending 2 to the combination:
Add 2 to the combination: [1, 2].
Since the length of the combination is 2 (k), add [1, 2] to the results.
Backtrack to explore other possibilities.
Start = 3, so we consider appending 3 to the combination:
Add 3 to the combination: [1, 3].
Since the length of the combination is 2 (k), add [1, 3] to the results.
Backtrack to explore other possibilities.
Start = 4, so we consider appending 4 to the combination:
Add 4 to the combination: [1, 4].
Since the length of the combination is 2 (k), add [1, 4] to the results.
Backtrack to explore other possibilities.
Start = 5, so we consider appending 5 to the combination:
Add 5 to the combination: [1, 5].
Since the length of the combination is 2 (k), add [1, 5] to the results.
Backtrack to explore other possibilities.
Move to the next number, which is 2, and initiate backtrack: backtrack(2, []).
At this point, we'll consider combinations starting with 2.
In the backtrack function (similar process as before):
Start = 2, so we consider appending 2 to the combination:
Add 2 to the combination: [2].
Recursively call backtrack with start = 3: backtrack(3, [2]).
Start = 3, so we consider appending 3 to the combination:
Add 3 to the combination: [2, 3].
Since the length of the combination is 2 (k), add [2, 3] to the results.
Backtrack to explore other possibilities.
Start = 4, so we consider appending 4 to the combination:
Add 4 to the combination: [2, 4].
Since the length of the combination is 2 (k), add [2, 4] to the results.
Backtrack to explore other possibilities.
Start = 5, so we consider appending 5 to the combination:
Add 5 to the combination: [2, 5].
Since the length of the combination is 2 (k), add [2, 5] to the results.
Backtrack to explore other possibilities.
Repeat steps 4-5 for the remaining numbers (3, 4, 5).
